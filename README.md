# Webcam-face-detection
Not a whole lot going on yet. Just detects faces with my laptop's Webcam following a tutoria  using openCV. I want to train it to recognise specific faces, to hopefully replace saved passwords on browser for email and other sites for easier and safer login and as I learn more I want to try to implement an ASL recognizer.
